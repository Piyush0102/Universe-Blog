    <h1> The First Second of the Big Bang </h1>
      <p>
        The most momentous second in the history of the big bang was its ‘First Second’. In that first second, space and time, matter and energy were
        set into motion. The key to understand the universe is within understanding the first second of the big bang.
        Everything we see comes from one miraculous moment, the big bang. The big bang is considered by many as an explosion in space, but it is actually
        the explosion of space. In the first second, the universe evolved more radically than it had in its 13.8 billion years of span. We measure time
        in hours, days and weeks. For us, one second is like just a flick of finger. But to understand the first second of the big bang we need a whole
        new concept of time. Here we will be measuring time in Plank Time. One plank time is equal to 10-43seconds! By breaking time in such tiny
        fragments, we could observe the birth of our universe moments by moments. Some scientists believe that at instant of creation, there was only
        one super force which ruled the universe. But as the universe cooled, various forces broke off from the super force. The first force to split was
        gravity. But gravity is not the only governing force in the cosmos.

        The universe at that time was a superhot ball of fire billions of degrees hot and dense beyond imagination. Gravity had begun shaping the future
        of the cosmos. By the 10 millionth tick of the plank time another stupendous event took place. As the universe cooled down further another major
        force broke apart, i.e. The Strong Nuclear Force.
        Everywhere we look at the universe, we see almost the same number of galaxies in every direction. It means, the universe is uniformly distributed
        or is homogeneous. But the even distribution of the universe posed a problem to which in 1979 a young physicists, Alan Guth proposed a theoretical
        solution, Inflation. Inflation is the sudden expansion of a volume of space. As the universe was born, it expanded at speed greater than that of
        light. But doesn’t it break the basic law of physics, that ‘nothing can travel faster than the speed of light’. ‘NO’, it doesn’t, as here the
        objects do not move but instead, the space between the objects expands.

        We can also see the big bang with the help of T.V statics. T.V statics are the ‘black and white noisy’ things that used to appear on old
        televisions when there was signal loss. In that statics, 1% of the light comes from the big bang. This was discovered in 1964 when two astronomers
        were listening to the radio signals and accidently they picked a background noise or hum, which was the noise of creation of the universe. When
        the universe became transparent 380,000 years after the big bang the noise was travelling since then. With the help of this background noise,
        scientists made a map, an infrared map of the universe and called it Cosmic Microwave Background (CMR). With the help of this we are able to
        look as far as 13.67 billion years. The secrets of inflation are hidden in here. To understand inflation, European Space Agency (ESA) launched a
        temperature sensitive satellite in 2009. Its primary task was to scan the temperature of the visible universe. The result from the Plank’s
        satellite produced a detailed infrared map of the universe. There are still two more aspects to prove the inflation and the big bang.
        The inflation expanded the then known universe everywhere but at different rate due to which ‘Gravitational Waves’ were produced. This wave
        stretch and contracts the universe itself and travels just like ripples in a pond. The search for the evidence of gravitational waves ended on
        March 2014, when researchers working at the South Pole Telescope made a stunning discovery by observing ‘microwave polarization’. It was the very strong evidence which backed the inflation theory.
        The early universe was full of matter but without mass, and matter with no mass moves at the speed of light. Today, our universe is full of stars
        and galaxies which certainly do have mass. So where did this mass come from? Apparently there is some type of field present throughout the
        universe and when the different elementary particles interact with this field they gain mass. More the object passes through this field, more the
        mass it gains. Scientists call it the ‘Higgs Field’. The Higgs field is invisible and stretches throughout the entire universe and is accompanied
        by a particle called the ‘Higgs Boson’. Without the Higgs field and Higgs Boson there is no mass. The Higgs field was really a beautiful idea
        whose presence was confirmed on March 14, 2013 by Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in CERN. The discovery of Higgs Boson was one of the final key in
        understanding the big bang. Now there are all the pieces which are needed to create a beautiful universe in which we live today.
        When the Higgs field first came into contact after the first second of the big bang, it became the reason for splitting of the super force.
        During the end of the first second of the big bang two final forces split off from the super force, they were ‘Weak Nuclear Force’ and
        ‘Electromagnetic Force’. These four fundamental forces governs all the ‘laws of physics’. They drive the evolution of the universe. The first
        second of the big bang is over; in the next few minutes the universe cools enough for the proton and neutron to form first atomic nuclei. Another
        380,000 must pass before the first atoms are created. In hundreds and millions of years, those atoms will clump up together to form stars and
        galaxies like the Milky Way.

        We have gone much farther in the study of our universe right from its birth to the exact moment and in the coming future, we will surely derive
        mathematically how our universe began. It may take many centuries for such mathematical proof to come up but till then the scientific
        advancements won’t stop and possibly the advanced generation of humans might be living on Mars or on Titan or on some other habitable planet or
        moon when the mathematical proof gets published. Every person’s life is just ‘a Blink of an Eye’ compared to the Cosmos.
