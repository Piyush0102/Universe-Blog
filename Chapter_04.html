    <h1> Journey from the Center of a Star </h1>
      <p>
        Starting deep inside a star there follows a brutal journey of a tiny packet of light; a photon, from its ancient birth in a star’s core to its
        escape from the surface. The universe is home to billions of galaxies each made up of billions of stars which shines brightly. Light is one of
        the basic building blocks of life. Every piece of matter in the universe above ‘Absolute Zero’ produces light, including humans.   It is a
        fundamental part of everything present around us. Light is also the fastest thing to travel in the entire cosmos. Though, it takes millions of
        years for a photon to escape out from a star’s surface. Let us begin an amazing journey of photons.
        Inside a star there are layers of hydrogen gas hundreds and thousands of miles deep and at its center its core is present where photons are
        created. Inside the core of a star the hydrogen atoms slam together 100 million quadrillion times each second!! Some of these collisions are so
        powerful that atoms fuse together releasing energy. Each collision creates a tiny burst of energy, a packet of light, a photon. But these photons
        are nothing like the light which we see. Instead it has massive amount of energy and is deadly.

      <p>
        In a star’s core, every photon starts as a Gamma Ray, the most energetic and deadliest form of light. These rays are so deadly that if it travels
        through humans, it will rip off the atoms and fracture the DNA. A photon roughly takes million years to travel through a star’s core to its
        surface. If it would travel straight it just takes 2 seconds! But something turns seconds into eternity. A photon encounters a hot dense soup of
        hydrogen gas which stretches for up to 400,000 miles. This is called as Radiation Zone and surrounds the core. The mass present above compresses
        the hydrogen gas to such an extent that is becomes denser than lead and nearly impossible to pass through. These gases aren’t just dense.
        They are superheated to 12.5 million oF! The gas and the radiation zone are transformed into what is called Plasma (the fourth state of matter)
        which is electrically charged.
        When a gamma ray photon enters the radiation zone it gets smashed into one of the charged particles of plasma which momentarily absorbs the
        photon and the spits it out and then the photon get smashed into another particle. The photon gets bounced in and thrown out through the
        radiation zone, slowing its progress. This bruising process transforms the photon. For over several hundred thousand years or sometimes million
        years the photon keeps bouncing through the dense radiation zone. Each collision takes a tiny bit of energy resulting in the transformation from
        a gamma ray to an X-ray. The photon has made it through the radiation zone, but its quest for reaching out the surface is not finished yet. Now,
        it is about to hitch a ride through a violent place which makes stars roar!

      <p>
        The X-ray photon now enters a mysterious boiling zone, the Convection Zone. It lies between the radiation zone and surface of a star. This region
        is still opaque to our telescopes. Talking of our sun (due to its closeness) NASA’s Solar Dynamic Observatory hears the convection zone. At the
        bottom of the convection zone, these X-ray photons smash into atoms in the plasma. But this time the photons are absorbed by the atoms and ride
        the boiling zone to the top. This journey takes just couple of weeks. In this time, the photon gets transformed again. The temperature at the
        bottom of the convection zone is 367,000 oF while its top is just 10000 oF. So, as the photon rises up it cools, losing its energy and changes
        from an X-ray photon to visible light. At the top of the convection zone, the atom releases the photon which shoots out as visible light. The
        photon is now just below the star’s surface or in scientific terms called as a Photosphere. But the churning convection zone unleashes another
        force which threatens the light’s escape.
        A powerful force stops the photon preventing its light and energy leaving the star’s surface. That force is ‘Magnetism’. The magnetic fields are
        so strong that it actually stops the convective motion of hot inner material flowing to the surface. The magnetism that creates Sun Spots
        (areas where light is trapped) forms field lines covering the entire surface of stars. And as we all know, stars are huge ball of gas so unlike
        earth, they rotate faster at their equator than at poles which twists and tangles the magnetic fields resulting in magnetic mayhem. So when
        these fields emerge form a star’s surface they have all the energy stored in them. Where the magnetic fields twists, the flow of plasma containing
        photon can’t reach the surface. When two magnetic fields interact with each other, they create solar flare. The energy released here is equal to
        millions of nuclear weapons exploded together simultaneously. But the solar flare also releases the trapped photon.

        After nearly a million year journey, the photon finally burst out from the star’s surface. The next time when you look at the sky you might
        consider the amazing journey the photon had taken on their way reaching us. How they were created in a star’s core by nuclear reaction and then
        bounced around and got degraded into lower energy photons and then in the convective zone they were carried by mass motions of gases and finally
        at the edge they were set free.
