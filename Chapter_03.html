    <h1> Stars </h1>
      <p>
        Stars are big, they are hot and they are everywhere. They rule our entire universe. Born in violence, struggling throughout their entire life
        and die in epic explosions. They fill the entire universe with stardust, the building block of life. Stars are what make our universe complete.
        The night sky is packed with stars. There are over 100 billion stars in The Milky Way galaxy and there are such 100 billion galaxies in the
        observable universe. There are more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on the earth. Most of the stars are so far away from us
        that we know very little about them. For instance, ‘Alpha centauri’ our nearest neighbor star is 4.3LY away from us!! But there’s one star which
        is close enough to us and virtually everything what we know about stars we have learnt from him, and that star is our Sun. From earth, our sun is
        nothing but a blinding ball of light. But as we filter the glare we see its true colors. It is a big ball of superheated gas which has been
        lightning our solar system for nearly 4.6 billion years and dominates all lifeforms on earth. The sun is 93 million miles away from us. Our sun
        has a radius of 432,690 miles. Yet it is tiny compared to some really big stars out there. ETA Carinae is over 5 million times larger than our sun.
        Betelgeuse is about 300 times larger than ETA Carinae. If Betelgeuse replaced our Sun, then it would reach as far as Jupiter. But, it is nothing
        compared to this monster, a billion times larger than our Sun and the largest star ever found, VY Canis Majoris!!!
        Stars burn in different colors, from red to yellow to blue. Some live alone while others live in pairs. Each star is one of its kind, yet all of
        the start their lives in a same way, as clouds of gas and dust called Nebulas which are billions of miles across drifting in space forming
        spectacular shapes like the Flame nebula, the Horsehead nebula, the Orion nebula and much more…. Each nebula is a star nursery where millions of
        stars are being born.

        Some of the dramatic parts are not the glorious clouds, but the dark parts where real action is happening in terms of star formation. But these
        clouds are so dense and thick that this event is hidden from the view of normal space telescopes (like Hubble). But for Spitzer Space Telescope
        (launched in 2003 and retired in 2020) it is not as such a difficult task as it is an infrared telescope. It only sees heat which passes through
        these thick clouds. In this way, Spitzer sees new stars being born.
        All you need to create a star is hydrogen gas, gravity and time. Gravity pulls these clouds of dust and gas into a giant swirling vortex. Over
        hundreds and thousands of years, the cloud gets thicker and hotter and forms a giant spinning disk bigger than our solar system!! At the center
        of this vortex, gravity crushes the gas into a super dense, super-hot ball. Pressure builds until huge jets of gases burst out from center which
        may be many LY across! Gravity keeps the pressure on sucking in gas and dust particles smashing into one another, generating more and more heat.
        Over the next half a billion years, the young stars will get brighter and hotter. The temperature at its core reaches to 15 billion degrees.
        Only at that mind boggling temperatures atoms of gas fuse into each other releasing massive amount of energy and a star is born. It will shine
        for millions or billions or even perhaps trillions of years.

        Stars produce massive amount of heat and light for over billions of years. Over the early 20th century no one thought how a star does that or
        what thrives the energy of a star. Over the next few years, many scientists had joined the race to find the energy source of the stars. It took a
        genius to discover it; Albert Einstein. His theories proved that stars could tap energy into atoms. The secrets of the stars was his famous
        equation ‘E=Mc2’. In some sense, matter which makes up our whole body is concerted energy. Einstein showed us that it is possible to release the
        energy by smashing two atoms together. In the modern world it is called as Nuclear Fusion. Now scientists are trying to make a star’s core
        (on a much smaller Scale) by a controlled fusion reaction! In Oxford, London there is an £ 80000 machine called ‘The Tokamak’. It is a device
        which uses a powerful magnetic field to confine hot plasma in shape of torus to recreate the core of a star. Inside a Tokamak, Hydrogen atoms
        repel each other naturally. So to smash them together, they are heated up to 300 million degrees. At these temperatures the Hydrogen atoms moves
        so fast that they couldn’t avoid repelling and smash into each other creating a Helium atom and a small amount of pure energy. The Tokamak can
        maintain fusion for only a fraction of seconds, but inside a star fusion continues for billions of years thus creating incredible amount of energy.
        The engine that drives a star is gravity. That’s why stars are big and huge. Fusion at the core of a star generates an explosive force of about a
        billion nuclear bombs every second!
        A star is a gigantic Hydrogen bomb. So why just it doesn’t blow apart? The answer is simple, gravity. As we know that the life of a star is a
        constant struggle between gravity and fusion. The gravity tries to compress a star and fusion tries to blow it apart. The balance between the two
        forces results in the stabilization of a star. This power struggle plays out over the entire life of a star. Two awesome forces of nature in a
        dynamic standoff. As this battle ranges, the star blasts out heat and light but also something far more destructive.
        A photon isn’t just a particle of light. When large number of photons gathers over the star’s surface, they create extreme turbulences and
        shockwaves. The speeding gases also generate powerful loops of ‘magnetic field’. Some loops are so large that the Earth can pass right through
        them leaving room to spare! As the star rotates, the loops crash into the surface. Their view might be spectacular but standing near to them
        might prove deadly. When these charged particles are erupted into the space they are called ‘solar wind’. These solar winds are so harmful that
        they can damage satellites, space shuttles and may also put astronaut’s life in danger.

        Each beam of light makes an epic journey. Yet many stars are so far away that light from that stars take millions or even billions of years to
        reach us and as that beam of light reaches us it gets way too weaker to feel. For instance, the light from ETA Carinae left 8000 years ago, the
        light from Betelgeuse has been travelling since Columbus discovered Americas 500 years ago! Even light from our sun takes 8 minutes and 20seconds
        to reach us. Understanding how star works might save us in the future. From the moment of its birth, every star is destined to die. Some die
        without making very big noise, but others die in huge and epic explosions called ‘supernova’.
        We all know that the life of a star is the constant struggle between gravity and fusion. When the star is drained out of its fuel, gravity
        overcomes the fusion and crushes the star to its core. Our Sun is no exception. Every second it burns 600 million tons of hydrogen. As the hydrogen
        slowly runs out the fusion slows down giving gravity the edge. As the gravity crushes the core, the gravity fight backs by heating up the outer
        layers resulting in the expansion of a star and this stage is called as a ‘Red Giant’. When our Sun will reach the red giant stage, it will swell
        up to 10 times its size reaching till Mars. But this won’t happen for the next 5 billion years. So, on an individual basis we are safe but as a
        species we are not. The red giant star is self-destructive. Its core becomes dangerously unstable. Slowly the layers of the star start to
        disintegrate. All that remains is an intensely hot and dense core. The red giant has now become a ‘White Dwarf’. Our Sun will end its life as a
        white dwarf not greater than the size of the Earth but a million times denser. Betelgeuse which is less than 600LY from Earth is way much younger
        than our Sun (it is only 10 million years old) is near its death. The reason is simple, its size. Stars like that burn their fuel quickly and die
        fast. Betelgeuse is a completely different beast than our Sun; it is a ‘Red Supergiant’. When stars generate iron (Fe) in their core, they are
        doomed. Their core tries to fuse into much more heavier elements but Fe absorbs all the energy which stops the fusion process, leading to its
        death. The corpse (or the core) of such giant stars are called ‘Neutron Stars’. They are just 20 miles across but unimaginably heavy.
      </p>

      <p>
        A dying star doesn’t just leave a white dwarf or a neutron star. When massive stars die, they seed the universe with stardust full of elements.
        These are the raw materials to build new stars, planets, solar systems and off course us. We live in an age of stars, but it will come to an end.
        Trillions of years from now, all the Hydrogen in the universe will be used up and since Hydrogen will not be available, new stars are not born.
        Slowly the universe will get colder and darker and when the last star burns out the universe will become dark once again. Luckily we live in a
        golden age of the universe. We live in a stage where stars glow and illuminate the night sky. For now, stars will continue to fill the darkness
        in the night sky.
