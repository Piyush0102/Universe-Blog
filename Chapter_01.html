    <h1> The Big Bang </h1>
      <p>
        The universe as we know it today was not same in the past and definitely will not remain same in the future. The universe is continuously evolving.
        Speaking of evolution, our universe has evolved a lot from the time of big bang. When the universe was born 13.8 billion years ago in what is
        called as ‘The Big Bang’ it was not in its present state. Instead, it was a hot dense ball of fire called ‘The Primordial Soup’. The big bang was
        so immense that it brought all the matter and weight of the entire universe which we see today.

      <p>
        But, our universe didn’t have a smooth starting as an infant. Instead it had a rough beginning. The first force to emerge from the big bang was
        ‘Gravity’. The faith of the universe was dependent on that exact moment. If the gravity would’ve been a little weaker, all the objects which we
        see, all the huge galaxies and everything would fall apart. If it would’ve been a little stronger, the universe would have collapsed instantly.
        But luckily, for us the gravity was in the exact amount needed. But only gravity hadn’t been enough to build such a masterpiece which we see today.
        It needed ‘Dark Matter’ to build the entire cosmos. Dark matter is the key element which binds all the things including huge galaxies and prevents
        them from falling apart. It is invisible to us but we know it is there. The discussion regarding the presence of dark matter took pace when
        scientists ran stimulations on a supercomputer. They created a virtual universe with the present amount of gravity, but the amount didn’t seem to
        be right. All the galaxies were falling apart in the virtual universe. Then they added an extra amount of gravity and eureka!! The universe was
        taking a perfect shape. Scientists wondered about the extra amount of gravity. The suspense of this mysterious thing was for a time when dark
        matter was discovered through Gravitational Lensing.

        During the big bang, two particles were created namely Matter and its counterpart Antimatter like positron (which is an anti-electron).
        For every matter, antimatter was present. For the matter to win the war against antimatter, it had to be just one more. If it would’ve been other
        way around the universe could’ve been made of antimatter and might had been similar.
        The big bang created a cosmic shockwave of pure energy which spread all the elements and minerals through the entire cosmos at a very high
        speed (probably greater than that of light). During the big bang, the temperatures were incredibly high! But as the universe expanded, it also
        started to cool. Still the temperature wasn’t sufficiently cooled so that the energy could be transformed into matter according to Einstein’s
        mass energy equivalence. At around 47,000 years, as the universe cools, its behavior begins to be dominated by matter rather than radiation.
        At around 370,000 years, the universe finally becomes cool enough for neutral atoms to form and as a result it also became ‘transparent’ for the
        first time. The first element to form was hydrogen followed by helium and lithium. The first stars were formed just after 200 million years after
        the big bang. When the stars first illuminated the cosmos, the universe went from ‘the age of darkness’ to ‘the age of splendor’. The first
        galaxies formed 1 billion years after the big bang. Over the next 10 billion years, countless new and enormous galaxies took shape.

        The shockwave which big bang created is still continuing. The universe is still expanding even today. In fact, the expansion is speeding up. But
        something weird is helping the process of speeding. That weird thing is ‘dark energy’. If this expansion continues, then 100 million years from
        now, our galactic neighbors will be out of site!
        If we want to understand ourselves at some fundamental level then we do have to understand the big bang very well. The big bang, a brief moment
        in time, which holds answers about our present, past and future. Each discovery brings us closer about understanding our universe.
